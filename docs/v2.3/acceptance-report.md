# ArmorBreak V2.3.0 implementation and acceptance report

This report follows taskbook §15. It reports the latest evidence available for the engineering branch and explicitly separates implementation from release readiness. It does **not** claim a complete V2.3.0 Stable release.

## 1. BASELINE

- Repository: `LYL-Z/dsh-armorbreak`; latest live `origin/main` checked on 2026-10-29: `66ec0017af4b9d636f09e45f7cf55eed060512ac`.
- Baseline tag: `v2.2.0` exists; no V2.3 tag is created.
- Branch: `feature/v2.3-universal-program-intelligence`; implementation branch was created from the exact main SHA above.
- M6 source: `965fbe4fa9abd2af73644865a56d8db64c8a6089`; local evidence commit: `945a8363a77a8e580609854f82859ea774c8b031`.
- Windows 11 build 26300, x64; baseline and M6 recorded Node `v24.16.0`, npm `11.13.0`; TypeScript lock `5.9.3`.
- Frozen M0 full test: 530/530 on the baseline after setting TEMP/TMP to a same-volume worktree directory; default cross-volume run had 6 environment-dependent failures and was retained in evidence. Candidate M6 evidence reports 647/647 on the exact M6 source SHA.

## 2. IMPLEMENTED

The following capability groups are present in committed source and their cited evidence is local evidence, not exact-head GitHub CI:

- M1: bounded artifact identification and archive inventory; source commit `3135688b3a5cbea89798bc0c61a2a45abfa38312`.
- M2: JS/TS source symbols and local references; source commit `47b5869a7d18e32c057aa6d2083693f920a21340`.
- M3: bounded PE/ELF/Mach-O Program IR and optional real Ghidra integration; source/evidence commits `ba3c5ea4134f138bca22d1a6aa597f1e7f2b0cc4`, `e57287f5abc9fb9ba86cb686736f67f3ab030357`.
- M4: offline security evidence correlation, redaction, JSON/SARIF results; source commit `23af85c900e54a2ac0f6bdf93ce2aad34b65d263`.
- M5: caller-supplied behavior contracts and finite comparison of precomputed JSON outputs; source commit `7e42b1a5b5f1cf9c8833dd355b6c266cc62b15d3`.
- M6: capability status metadata and fixed L0-only MCP workflow discovery/start; source commit `965fbe4fa9abd2af73644865a56d8db64c8a6089`.

Observed M6 runtime registry: 53 capabilities / 12 domains (51 L0, 1 L1, 1 L2), 14 workflows, 10 DSH model tools, 8 MCP tools, 7 skills, and 0 registry diagnostics. Original Core contract `0.1.0-p1` and protocol v1 remain unchanged. The exact registry snapshot and tests are in `evidence/m6/m6-validation.json`.

## 3. VERIFIED

| Area | Observed local evidence | Status and limit |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | `evidence/m0/test-results.json`; baseline SHA above; 530/530 canonical full suite | Frozen baseline; default cross-volume failures remain documented |
| M1 | `evidence/m1/test-results.json` | Local fixture tests; exact-head CI not yet recorded |
| M2 JS/TS | `evidence/m2/test-results.json`; 5 positive and 5 syntax-negative per language in authored fixtures | Partial S2 for JS/TS only; not broad language semantics or taint |
| M3 native | `evidence/m3/native-ghidra-runner-e2e.json`, `m3-validation.json`; Ghidra 12.1.4, Temurin 21, six PE/ELF/Mach-O cases, x64 and i386 | Real host E2E; each is static (`inputExecuted:false`); outputs can be partial/bounded; no macOS host |
| M4 corpus | `evidence/m4/vulnerability-corpus-metrics.json`; 20 groups / 60 snippets; TP=20 FP=20 FN=0 TN=20; precision .50, recall 1.00, FPR .50 | Authored regex corpus only; not a real-world accuracy estimate or independent confirmation |
| M5 behavior | `evidence/m5/m5-validation.json`; 11 cases, 8 compared, 5 pass, 3 fail, 3 inconclusive | Authored JS/Python local fixtures; ArmorBreak itself receives precomputed results and does not execute programs |
| M6 integration | `evidence/m6/m6-validation.json`; full suite 647/647, focused CLI/MCP/API 24/24, typecheck exit 0 | Windows / Node 24 local exact-source run; no exact-head CI yet |
| Node 22 compatibility | `evidence/p0-h/node22-local-validation.json`; exact source `679bbeb6152d9f9c9f151c5bae6f7c01d098b357`, 647/647 and TypeScript check exit 0 | Local Windows Node `v22.23.4`; the invalid temp-root attempt is retained separately; Linux/CI still outstanding |
| Performance | [`performance-report.md`](performance-report.md) and sanitized raw benchmark | Same benchmark script/Node/OS family; baseline CPU identity not recorded, no peak-memory comparison |

The stage JSON records include exact source SHAs, commands, counts and evidence hashes. Fixture SHA-256 values are catalogued in `fixture-catalog.json` and stage evidence. M3 tool versions are in its exact evidence record. Full raw M6 test output is ignored locally; the committed JSON records its log digest.

## 4. SECURITY

- L0 new analyses use existing Core/Engine/PolicyGateway routes and bounded local inputs. MCP `armorbreak_workflow` accepts only shipped L0 workflows; caller-provided steps, principal, approvals and commands are not accepted.
- M1–M4 do not execute target files. M5 fixture tests run self-authored JS/Python test programs as part of tests and pass only precomputed JSON outcomes into the product capability. Those fixtures are not arbitrary user targets.
- M3 Ghidra 12.1.4 processed six self-authored PE/ELF/Mach-O fixtures; records show `inputExecuted:false`.
- M4 aggregate vulnerability status stays `not_tested`; imported “confirmed” claims cannot confirm findings. Its authored contrast corpus has FPR 0.50.
- L1: historical harmless Docker isolation evidence exists, but latest direct Docker check on this continuation could not connect to the daemon. No current L1 readiness is claimed.
- L2: no new remote workflow was added. L3 remains refused.
- An independent security review, exact-head security scan, exhaustive Windows reparse/TOCTOU matrix, hostile archive/fuzzing campaign and full approval/session adversarial matrix have not been completed.

## 5. PERFORMANCE

See [`performance-report.md`](performance-report.md). In the recorded seven-step workflow benchmark, candidate p50/p95 was 1,267.052/1,322.097 ms versus baseline 1,276.771/1,331.449 ms. M0 did not record CPU identity or peak memory; the comparison is descriptive only, and a second diagnostic run showed substantial SAST timing variation. Candidate end-of-process RSS is not a peak measurement. The 100-run timeout/cancel soak, large-file streaming throughput, peak memory, concurrency and cancellation latency are not verified.

## 6. COMPATIBILITY

- Runtime counts at baseline: 46 capabilities, 9 workflows, 10 DSH tools, 7 MCP tools, 7 skills.
- M6: 53 capabilities, 14 workflows, 10 DSH tools, 8 MCP tools, 7 skills.
- A fresh runtime enumeration against the M6 worktree found all 46 baseline capability IDs and all 9 baseline workflow IDs still present (missing IDs: none); capability risk counts remain 51 L0 / 1 L1 / 1 L2.
- Existing Core version `0.1.0-p1`, protocol v1, CLI command families and policy path are retained. M6 adds one fixed MCP tool and support-status fields.
- The live registry has no diagnostics. The compatibility matrix was corrected to report M5/M6 as locally implemented instead of stale `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
- Old user task/report files were not migrated. Read compatibility on the local committed fixtures is covered by the existing suite, but no full external user-data corpus or upgrade migration was exercised.

## 7. BLOCKED / PARTIAL / UNSUPPORTED

- **P0-H `IN_PROGRESS`, release `NOT_READY`:** Node 22 has a successful local Windows run, but no exact-head GitHub CI run, Ubuntu/Linux CI, independent security review, release artifacts/SBOM/attestation or upgrade/rollback drill is yet recorded.
- **M2 PARTIAL:** JS/TS only; no four-language S3, inter-file taint or broad language matrix.
- **M3 PARTIAL:** native P0 local static E2E is present; P1 bytecode families/APK/DEX refresh and hostile-input isolated E2E are deferred/unverified.
- **M4 PARTIAL:** correlation only; advisory fetching/version evaluation and independent finding validation are unsupported; corpus FPR is 0.50.
- **M5 PARTIAL:** finite caller-supplied outcomes; no arbitrary source-to-spec inference and no global equivalence guarantee.
- **M6 PARTIAL:** Windows/Node24 only so far; exact PR-head CI and cross-platform tests outstanding.
- **Performance PARTIAL:** descriptive microbenchmark only; no peak-memory baseline or soak.
- **Docker/L1 BLOCKED on this host check:** Docker CLI present, Engine named pipe unavailable.
- **Formal release is not authorized:** no tag, merge or publication is performed in this task.

## 8. RELEASE READINESS

- Candidate/current evidence SHA at the previous pause: `945a8363a77a8e580609854f82859ea774c8b031`; M6 source SHA: `965fbe4fa9abd2af73644865a56d8db64c8a6089`.
- `npm test` at M6 SHA: 647/647; focused CLI/MCP/API: 24/24; `npm run typecheck`: exit 0.
- Node 22.23.4 local validation at `679bbeb6152d9f9c9f151c5bae6f7c01d098b357`: full suite 647/647 and TypeScript check exit 0; the exact log hashes and invalid first attempt are recorded in `evidence/p0-h/node22-local-validation.json`.
- The V2.3-specific integrity validator generated a separate manifest and verified all 56 bound evidence/document files. A reversible byte-tamper probe was rejected (exit 1), then the restored bundle validated again. This is an integrity check only; its machine result says release readiness `NOT_READY`.
- The committed manifest binds evidence to source `4160645617888ee291d9ce13ebd1d9fe93e744d4`; post-commit validation passed on exact head `2201d600c449150ed811a67fec580b4315a39318` with 56 files checked.
- GitHub CI run IDs/URLs, exact-head statuses, package hashes, SBOM and attestation: **NOT_RUN / NOT_CREATED** at report time.
- Migration and rollback drill: **NOT_RUN**.
- Owner merge/tag/publish decision: pending; this report is not an authorization.
